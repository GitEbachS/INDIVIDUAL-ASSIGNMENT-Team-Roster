## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- There are many soccer teams available for users to view.  Ideally, users who want to use this app can authenticate through FireBase Oauth, and utilize this system to create/edit new members or teams, add members to their team, delete members or the team, and switch team members to a different team.
- Each team member has: an image, soccer player role, their name, and their team name on their profile.
- Each team has a View button to view all of the team members.
